# Codecademy's Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

## Project: Fix a broken version of a responsive website in this project!

In this project I fixed a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. I was provided with specs and a final project design to help guide in making adjustments to the broken code.

### Thoughts: 

I thought this would be simple but I had gotten used to building projects from scratch so it was a challenge to dive into already created code to understand what might have gone wrong. 

- Started by reading through the code and understanding what might be wrong
- Incurred easy-to-miss mistakes such as incorrectly linked stylesheets
- Used Chrome Devtools to debug and visualise
